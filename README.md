# Intro

I've been interested in Python programming for 7 years now. At first, I started to learn it to find some internships. My first internship was at Samsung, creating deep learning models for emoji prediction. 
To take my Python knowledge to the next level, I consumed the "Python3: Deep Dive: Part 1 - Functional" course by Dr. Fred Baptiste on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1/).
This made me understand Python on a much deeper level. Alongside working on a daily basis, I continued learning about Python from these courses.

Now, it is time to dig deeper. I want to understand the performance of Python code and what it actually does under the hood.

# Code problems
There are two main problems we will be focusing on:
* Creating a Julia set
* Solving a diffusion equation

These are simple, but very interesting numerical algorithms. They will allow us to demostrate the performance issues we may face.
